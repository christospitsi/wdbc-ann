A Neural Network Approach to Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC)

In this project, it is examined the usage of Artificial Neural Networks on the 
Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set, in order to classify a mass as benign or malignant, 
based on 30 features extracted from FNA biopsies.

The application was developed using ```R``` interface to ```Keras``` framework, in order to create and train a sequential model which uses the backpropagation algorithm.

For a detailed report on the application please refer to my personal blog.
